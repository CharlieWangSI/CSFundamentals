> What is a hash table?
A: In computer science, the hash data structure, also referred to as a hash table, is a type of data structure that stores each value by linking it to a key, forming key-value pairs, just like JavaScript objects.

> What is hashing?
A: Hashing is the conversion from a string to a numerical index.

> How does a hash table store data?
A: A hashing function is used to convert the key to a specific, fixed-length number, referred to as a hash code. Once a hash table has a hash code it can use as a key, it can figure out where to place the key-value pair in its internal array.

> How are hash tables and objects different?
A: If your data is a static number of distinct values of different types, then an object is the optimal choice. Use a hash table when your data contains a variable number of consistently formatted values, each with an identifier.

>Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
A:
A list of pets and their unique names:Hash table
The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend: Object
The name and location of every company in a given city: Object
All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual: Hash table
The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact: Object

>Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.
A:

customerDatabse=[]

function setCustomer(name, address, number){
  var i = hash(number)
  customerDatabase[i].push([number,{name,address}])
  RETURN customerDatabase
}

function lookupCustomer(customerDatabase, number){
  var i = hash(number)
  customerDatabase[i].forEach(pairs=>{
   if (pairs[0]===number){
     let results=pairs[1]
}
})
  RETURN results
}

>Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.
A: 

inventoryHash=[]

function setInventory(name, amount){
  var i = hash(name)
  inventoryHash[i].push([name,amount])
  RETURN inventoryHash
}

function lookupInventory(inventoryHash,name){
  var i = hash(name)
  inventoryHash[i].forEach(pairs=>{
   if (pairs[0]===name){
     let results=pairs[1]
}
})
  RETURN results
}

>Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.
A:

newspaperHash=[]

function setHash(content,publisher,publication_date){
  var i = hash({publisher,publication_date})
  newspaperHash[i].push([{publisher,publication_date},content])
  RETURN newspaperHash
}

function lookupNews(inventoryHash,publisher,publication_date){
  var i = hash({publisher,publication_date})
  newspaperHash[i].forEach(pairs=>{
   if (pairs[0]==={publisher,publication_date}){
     let results=pairs[1]
}
})
  RETURN results
}
