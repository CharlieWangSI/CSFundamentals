> What is a hash table?
A: In computer science, the hash data structure, also referred to as a hash table, is a type of data structure that stores each value by linking it to a key, forming key-value pairs, just like JavaScript objects.

> What is hashing?
A: Hashing is the conversion from a string to a numerical index.

> How does a hash table store data?
A: A hashing function is used to convert the key to a specific, fixed-length number, referred to as a hash code. Once a hash table has a hash code it can use as a key, it can figure out where to place the key-value pair in its internal array.

> How are hash tables and objects different?
A: If your data is a static number of distinct values of different types, then an object is the optimal choice. Use a hash table when your data contains a variable number of consistently formatted values, each with an identifier.

>Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
A:
A list of pets and their unique names:object
The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend: object
The name and location of every company in a given city: hash table
All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual: array
The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact: array

>Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.
A:

function lookupCustomer(name, address, number){
  CREATE HashMapCustomer
  CREATE HashMapName
  STORE name(key) into HashMapName and associate with address (value)
  STORE number(key) into HashMapCustomer and associate with HashMap (value)
}

>Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.
A: 

function createInventory(name, amount){
  CREATE HashMapInventory
  STORE name(key) into HashMapInventory and associate with amount (value)
  return HashMapInventory
}

function trackInventory(name, HashMapInventory){
  return HashMapInventory(name)
}

>Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.
A:

function lookforNewspapers(content, publisher,publication_date){
  CREATE HashMapNewspapers
  CREATE HashMapDate
  STORE publication_date(key) into HashMapDate and associate with content (value)
  STORE publisher(key) into HashMapNewspaper and associate with HashMapDate (value)
  return HashMapNewspapers
}
