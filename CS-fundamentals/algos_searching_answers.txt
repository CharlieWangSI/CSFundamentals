> What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: Check to see if a letter exists in a string

> What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: find the location of a number in a sorted array of numbers 

> Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: 7

> Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: 3

> Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: I would choose linear because it’s unsorted. Binary search requires sorted collection.

> Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: I would use binary search because for sorted collection binary search can discard data by comparing the sought after item to the middle item of the collection, making it much faster

> You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

A: 

function findWord(word,dictionary){
 var low =0;
 var high =dictionary.length-1;

 while (low <= high){
   var mid = Math.round((low + high) / 2);
   if (dictionary[mid] > word[i]){
     high = mid - 1;
     }else if (dictionary[mid] < word[i]){
     low = mid + 1;
     }
   else{
     return mid;
     }
   }
  }
  
  return “Not Found”;
 }
