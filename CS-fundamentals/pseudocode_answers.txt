> Why do programmers use pseudocode?
A: Pseudocode is an informal language that helps programmers to develop algorithms. It is a way to express what code should do without using a particular language's syntax.

> If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
A: It will not run on computer, nothing would happen. 

> Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
A: 

\INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number THEN
  PRINT first number
ELSE IF second number is greater than first number THEN
  PRINT second number
ELSE
  PRINT “TIE!”
END IF\

> Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
A: 

\INIT count to 1
INPUT a number
WHILE count is smaller than or equal to 100
  PRINT count
  count=count+1
END WHILE\

> Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
A:

\INPUT Object phonebook with multiple arrays of entries, each with two properties: name and number
INPUT name
INIT count to 0
INIT number
WHILE name is not equal to the number property of the entry
  count=count+1
END WHILE
Assign the number property of the entry to variable number
RETURN number\


> Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

A:

function search(phonebook, name){
for (let i=0;i<phonebook.length;i++){
if (name==phonebook[i].name){return phonebook[i].number;}
}
}
