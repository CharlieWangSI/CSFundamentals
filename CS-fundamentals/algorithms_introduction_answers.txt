> Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;

A: 

IF reservoir is empty
  Pour water into reservoir OUTPUT carafe
END IF
IF carafe is not on heatingPlate 
  Put carafe into heatingPlate OUTPUT heatedWater
END IF
IF more coffee is needed
  Add groundedCoffee into heatedWater THROUGH filter OUTPUT coffeeMade
END IF
RETURN coffeeMade

Washing dishes;

A:

WHILE sink is not full 
  fill sink with hot water OUTPUT hotSink
END WHILE 
WHILE there is soap left
  add soap into hotSink OUTPUT cleaningFluid 
END WHILE
WHILE there are dirty dishes left on the table
  soak dishes in cleaningFluid OUTPUT dishes
END WHILE
WHILE dishes are still dirty in the sink
  wash dishes OUTPUT washedDishes
  washedDishes OUTPUT rinsedDishes
  rinsedDishes OUTPUT cleanDishes 
END WHILE
RETURN cleanDishes

Cooking pastas:

A:

WHILE water is not boiled
  boil water in pot OUTPUT boiledWater
END WHILE 
WHILE water is plaine
  salt boiledWater with salt OUTPUT saltedWater
END WHILE
WHILE there is pasta on left on the table
  add pasta into saltedWater OUTPUT boiledPasta 
END WHILE
WHILE boiledPasta is not evenly cooked
  stir boiledPasta OUTPUT cookedPasta 
END WHILE
WHILE cookedPasta is not dry
  drain cookedPasta OUTPUT ready
RETURN ready

As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

A: 

- Tik Tok uses an AI-based video recommendation algorithm to drive user engagement and keep users on the platform
- Amazon uses a machine learning product recommendation algorithm to predict userâ€™s preference and drive conversion on purchase
- Facebook uses many data points about a user to create an algorithm to push the most relevant advertisements to a user. 

> Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

Efficient algorithm: easy to read and understand with clear logic, little redundancy, and minimal runtime
Inefficient algorithm: hard to read and understand with unclear logic, lots of redundancy, and complex runtime
