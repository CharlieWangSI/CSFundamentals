> Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;

A: 

Pour water INTO reservoir THEN
Put carafe INTO heatingPlate THEN
Add groundedCoffee INTO filter
RETURN coffeeMade

Washing dishes;

A:

FILL sink WITH hot water THEN
SOAK dishes THEN
ADD soap INTO sink THEN
WASH dishes THEN
RINSE  DISHES THEN
DRY dishes THEN
PUT AWAY dishes

Cooking pastas:

A:

BOIL water IN pot THEN
Salt water WITH salt THEN
Add pasta INTO water THEN
STIR pasta THEN
DRAIN pasta

As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

A: 

- Tik Tok uses an AI-based video recommendation algorithm to drive user engagement and keep users on the platform
- Amazon uses a machine learning product recommendation algorithm to predict userâ€™s preference and drive conversion on purchase
- Facebook uses many data points about a user to create an algorithm to push the most relevant advertisements to a user. 

> Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

Efficient algorithm: easy to read and understand with clear logic, little redundancy, and minimal runtime
Inefficient algorithm: hard to read and understand with unclear logic, lots of redundancy, and complex runtime
